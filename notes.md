## Git Intro
Git was completely new to me. Here are the basics:
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "note"
git log
git checkout b35f03b1790f
```
When I'm using Github, here are my most common commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/McChug/startup.git
git pull
git add .
git commit
git push
```
The pattern of pull, add, commit, and push should happen multiple times whenever I'm editting my code.
